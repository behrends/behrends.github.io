        We'll walk through the setup process to enable ReasonML for your next React Native project.

      <p class="note">
      It is well known that JavaScript has flaws. But even if its syntax and semantics were perfect, JavaScript would still be a <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">dynamic, untyped scripting language</a> with many inherent weak spots (<code>undefined is not a function</code>). In an effort to mitigate these, Facebook came up with <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> (a static type checker for JavaScript) and Microsoft created <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (a syntactical, typed superset of JavaScript) — to add static typing to JavaScript. Thus, errors in code can be detected already at compile time as opposed to risking runtime failures caused by bugs related to JavaScript’s untyped nature. These efforts certainly support engineering teams in obtaining more robust code bases — but aren’t we still only “sugar coating” JavaScript with these extra layers?
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      Functional languages with a static type system that compile to JavaScript could offer a comprehensive solution. <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is one example mainly targeting web applications while <a href="http://facebook.github.io/reason/">ReasonML (or simply Reason)</a> is a general purpose language. Reason is a new syntax for <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> with several compile targets next to JavaScript. For the React and React Native communities, Reason is especially worth paying attention to as it is developed and promoted by members of the React team. Although Reason is still heavily under development, I wanted to take Reason for a spin in a React Native project.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      To get started with Reason in a React web app we could use <em><a href="https://github.com/react-native-training/crra">create-reason-react-app</a></em>. As there is no <em>create-reason-react-native-app</em> yet, we need to go through a manual process to setup Reason for app development with React Native (assuming you’re already familiar with React Native):
      </p>

      <h2>Create React Native App</h2>
      <p class="note">
        Rather than trying to integrate Reason into an existing project I created a fresh React Native project using <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html">create-react-native-app</a> and <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a>:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
create-react-native-app AppWithReason
cd AppWithReason
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        Obviously, as we are working with some libraries that are in an early stage of development you should put your project under version control with git, so you might want to start committing in git now and after each of the following steps. We are going to use npm because it is used in the Reason docs but it should work with yarn as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Add BuckleScript to the project</h2>

      <p class="note">
        <a href="http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/">BuckleScript</a> is a compiler with first level support for both OCaml and Reason which we need to add as a dependency to our project:
      </p>

<pre class="note"><code>
npm install --save-dev bs-platform
</code></pre>

      <p class="note">
Once we are done with the setup, BuckleScript will automatically compile Reason code to JavaScript in the background for us, similar to Babel.
      </p>

      <h2>Include ReasonReact</h2>
      <p class="note">
        The React ecosystem is tightly integrated into React Native. So, in order to have React features like JSX available in Reason on the same level of abstraction like we are used to in JavaScript, we are going to include Reason language bindings for React with <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/">ReasonReact</a>:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
npm install --save-dev reason-react
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Provide BuckleScript bindings for React Native</h2>

      <p class="note">
        In addition to React features provided by ReasonReact we want to be able to use React Native components and APIs. There are <a href="https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-react-native">BuckleScript bindings for React Native</a>, which we add to our project directly from github because they are still in an early stage of development:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
npm install --save-dev https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-react-native.git
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Configure BuckleScript</h2>
      <p class="note">
        BuckleScript needs to be configured to work with JSX and the React Native bindings added previously. This is achieved by adding a file <code>bsconfig.json</code> to the root folder of the project:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
{
  "name": "AppWithReason",
  "reason": {
      "react-jsx": 2
  },
  "bs-dependencies": ["bs-react-native", "reason-react"],
  "sources": [{
      "dir": "re"
  }]
}
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        Take note of the setting for <code>sources</code> where <code>re</code> is declared to be the name of the folder containing the Reason source files in our project.
      </p>

      <h2>Add scripts to compile Reason to JavaScript with BuckleScript</h2>

      <p class="note">
        Two scripts need to be added to <code>package.json</code>, thus simplifying the use of BuckleScript from the command line without memorizing lengthy commands. Add two lines with keys <code>build</code> and <code>watch</code> to the <code>scripts</code> section of <code>package.json</code> like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-native-scripts start",
  "eject": "react-native-scripts eject",
  "android": "react-native-scripts android",
  "ios": "react-native-scripts ios",
  "test": "node node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --watch",
  "build": "bsb -make-world -clean-world"
  "watch": "bsb -make-world -clean-world -w"
},
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Write your first React Native component with Reason</h2>
      <p class="note">
        Now we can start coding in Reason! Create the folder which will contain our Reason code:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
mkdir re
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        And launch BuckleScript in watch mode:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
npm run watch
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        This will automatically compile our Reason code to JavaScript whenever a change occurs. By the way, the BuckleScript compiler is very fast and won’t slow down the fast development experience we are used to with live reload in React Native.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Now switch to your editor to add your first React Native component written in Reason:
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
open ReactNative;
let app () =&gt;
  &lt;View style=Style.(style [flex 1., justifyContent `center,
  alignItems `center])&gt;
    &lt;Text value="Reason is great!" /&gt;
  &lt;/View&gt;;
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        And save this file as <code>re/app.re</code>.
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
import React from 'react';
import { app } from './lib/js/re/app.js';
export default app;
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        This component isn’t part of our app yet. So, in order to use this component written in Reason as the app’s new root component, we need to change <code>App.js</code> like this:
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Now we can see <code>Reason is great!</code> being displayed in our app, as defined in <code>re/app.re</code>. 

      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If you’re using git for this project, you should extend .gitignore with these two lines
      </p>

      <pre class="note"><code>
lib/
.merlin
      </code></pre>

      <p class="note">
        <code>lib</code> is the folder where BuckleScript writes the compiled JavaScript and <code>.merlin</code> is a config file generated by Ocaml’s tool <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a>, that provides features like auto completion to editors. Worth mentioning is Ocaml’s type inference feature which among other benefits delivers automatically annotated code. For example in VS Code:
      </p>

      <img src="type_inference.png" alt="Type inference">

      <p class="note">
        To get this working on your machine, you need to install Reason’s tool chain <a href="https://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli">reason-cli</a>. Finally, in VS Code, add the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freebroccolo.reasonml">extension for Reason</a> and the type annotations should be visible automatically.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        I hope you’ll have fun with Reason!
      </p>
