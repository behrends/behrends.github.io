      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p class="note">
      There are certainly many web developers who want to develop mobile apps. 
      But who has enough time to learn languages ​​like Java, <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html">Kotlin</a> or Swift? 
      They want to work with the language they already use every day and (maybe) love: JavaScript. 
      There are several frameworks for developing apps with JavaScript: Cordova (formerly Phonegap), 
      Ionic, NativeScript, React Native, and certainly more. These are all open source frameworks 
      having certain advantages and flaws.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      With <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> and <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, an app is developed in a similar way to web applications by using HTML, 
      CSS and JavaScript. The resulting app executes the code in a WebView instead of a browser. With 
      this approach it is, however, difficult to create high quality apps that can compete with “real” 
      native apps. The UI of these apps often comes with just one look and feel that doesn’t adhere to 
      the quite distinguished guidelines of Android and iOS, the performance doesn’t match that of 
      native apps and there is a lack of native functions such as touch gestures.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> enable us to develop genuine native apps with JavaScript. UI elements 
      are native and not just replicated with HTML and CSS, as is the case with Cordova and Ionic. With 
      NativeScript and React Native, apps can be implemented for both Android and iOS. React Native however, 
      which was developed by Facebook, supports other platforms such as <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/building-for-apple-tv.html">Apple TV</a> and is conceptually similar to 
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/">ReactVR</a> (Virtual Reality). In addition to Facebook and Instagram, many well-known companies already use 
      React Native, including <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html">Airbnb, Tesla</a> and <a href="https://eng.uber.com/ubereats-react-native/">Uber</a>. With a great developer community and versatility, React 
      Native seems to be a future-proof approach for implementing native apps with JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      In addition, React Native could also be attractive to iOS developers who want to develop apps for Android 
      (or vice versa). Also, developers get significantly faster feedback during development compared to traditional 
      app development with XCode or Android Studio. Did I mention that you can develop simultaneously for Android and iOS?

      <p class="note">
        There are three different approaches to working with React Native: a complete and a lightweight installation, and 
        it is even possible to develop parts of a mobile app directly in the browser without installing anything. The remainder 
        of this article describes these three approaches.
      </p>

      <h2>React Native in the browser</h2>
      <p class="note">
        To get a first impression of React Native, only a browser with Internet connection is needed. Just click on 
        <a href="https://snack.expo.io/">https://snack.expo.io/</a> and you’re ready to go!
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        It’s hard to imagine an easier approach to get started with a complex technology than that offered by Expo Snack. There are no excuses not to try React Native. Expo Snack is a fabulous tool coming with an editor, a preview for iOS and Android and the option to save examples and share them with others. This is made possible by the different tools made by the developers at <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a> which can be used in addition to React Native. Next to an SDK with additional UI components and APIs, they also offer an app that executes these online examples directly on the smartphone. Of course for Android and iOS and all open source!
      </p>
      
      <p class="note">
        But there are also a few restrictions. Only one component can be developed at a time, and Expo Snack is usually not based on the most recent version of Expo and React Native. But overall, Expo Snack is a fantastic way to get to know React Native, to play with small experiments and share examples with others. Expo Snacks can also be embedded into web pages for documentation purposes. A variant of Expo Snacks is used by the cloud development environment <a href="https://repl.it/languages/react_native">repl.it</a>. There is even an <a href="https://repl.it/site/react_native">interactive 5-minute tutorial for React Native</a> for the browser.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Lightweight installation with Create React Native App and Expo</h2>
      <p class="note">
        Expo Snacks are fascinating but for the development of non-trivial apps with React Native an installation of the framework is required. Since March 2017, fortunately, there is a lightweight approach to installing React Native with little effort, again thanks to the developers at Expo. The only prerequisite is an installation of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, which should be the case with most web developers.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Two tools are needed for this: the <em><a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app">Create React Native App</a></em> command line tool and the Expo app already mentioned. The official documentation for React Native describes the procedure <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html">in detail</a>. This only takes a few minutes and the app projects created in this way can be easily tested in the Expo app on Android or iOS by scanning a QR code. In fact, this approach also allows the development of iPhone apps on Linux or Windows machines, without a Mac! Only an iOS device with the Expo app installed is needed. This is not possible when iPhone apps are developed with Swift and XCode.
      </p>
      
      <p class="note">
        There are also some limitations to this approach. Expo usually does not support the latest version of React Native and no libraries with native dependencies can be embedded (yet?). However, it is possible at any time to <em>eject</em> the project from the Expo environment, which is also required if you want to publish the app in an AppStore.
      </p>

      <h2>Full installation of React Native</h2>
      <p class="note">
        Finally, I briefly mention the full installation of React Native. It is quite possible that up to several hours of time have to be invested. For the Android version of the app Android Studio with the Android SDK is needed and for iOS development a Mac with XCode is mandatory. The procedure for this is again <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html">described</a> in the documentation for React Native.
      </p>
      
      <p class="note">
        This approach obviously poses a high initial effort. The two alternative approaches were therefore created to enable curious (web) developers to have quick and uncomplicated access to working with React Native. The complete installation is required for “real” productive work with React Native. So all features will be available with the latest version and the app can be published in the AppStores.
      </p>
      
      <p class="note">
        If you would like to try out React Native, you can do this with no extra effort with Expo Snack in the browser. For the first steps in development with React Native, CreateReact Native App is intended and anyone who is seriously interested in the fast, cross-platform development with React Native will finally have to work through a full installation — this is worthwhile even if it is relatively tedious.
